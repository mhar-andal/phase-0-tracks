ENCRYPT METHOD

- advance each letter one letter forward
  - run .next on each index
  - use ! to change index in place
- spaces remain as spaces
   

DECRYPT METHOD

- reverse encrypt
- go backward one letter

=begin
   
1. use a menu to ask user what they would like to do
  - menu as while loop
2. options of menu: 
  -Asks a secret agent (the user) whether they 
  would like to decrypt or encrypt a password
  -Asks them for the password
  -Conducts the requested operation, 
  prints the result to the screen
  -Quit program
