Game Plan

I've done parts of the jQuery course on Codeacademy so I'm a little exposed. I'm going to review the lessons I've done already as well as complete the ones I haven't done. After that, I should find a cheat sheet and start experimenting. I'll let my curiosity take it from there. I'm going to spend 2 hours, then take a break, than another 1-2 hours. I find this is efficient for me because it will allow me to retain the information better.
