What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

  The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be a computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing. - Mike Gancarz(Introduction of the Unix philosophy of the book Linux and the Unix Philosophy)

  With Linux, it never assumes that the user is competent. It always assumes you know what you are doing, and you can tell it to do anything you want. It gives the user a huge amount of power.

What is a VPS(Virtual Private Server)? What are some advantages of using a VPS?

  I've actually used VPSs or VPNs back in middle school when I played a game called Runescape and dove into the private server world of Runescape. I did very light coding in Java to the game engine, and I would make the game my own. When I was done, I uploaded my files onto a VPS and started the server so people can connect to it using a custom IP address I made through no-ip.

  A VPS is pretty much a remote computer that runs a copy of an operating system. You can install any software that runs on that OS, and these computers can stay on and continue to run your software. Some advantages is that you don't have to rely on your computer to run a server, you can setup a VPS that is dedicated to that task. Also they are very easy and fast to setup, and some can run for really cheap.

Why is it considered bad to run software as the root user of a Linux operating system?

  Running software as the root user defeats the purpose of the security model. Software is ment to be ran on a non-administrative account because if it is ran on a admin account, you can elevate the privileges of the software to modify the underlying system. Your system can also be more vulnerable to viruses because now it has access to everywhere on the system.
