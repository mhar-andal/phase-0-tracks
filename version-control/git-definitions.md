# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
   
    Version control is a system that can record changes to a folder or file. You can revert back to these changes as you work. It is useful because if you create an error you can revert back to a time where the error did not exist.
    
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    
    A branch is "folder" that contains commits. If multiple people are collabing on a project, each developer can have their own branch, and it the final steps of the project, you can merge your branches to create on big project.
    
    
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    
    A commit is a "save point" where any changes you make to a file are saved. A good commit message will say what changes have been done and to what file.
    
    Ex. "Added banking system to website shop"

* What is a merge conflict?

    A merge conflict is an error you get when merging branches. They can occur when commits in your current branch are not in the other commits, and vice versa.
